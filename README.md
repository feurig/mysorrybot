# mysorrybot (3d files and docs for my sorry bot).
Way back when I got myself elected VP of the Portland Area Robotics society we all had two sets of robots we were building. Line Following Maze Solvers and Free Range Navigators. I was more of a line following maze solver so when I found a larger than life sorry piece that fit perfetly within the size limitations for a maze solving robot, I had to try a build based on it. 

Here is a [video of my original sorry bot](docs/sorrybot.mov)

My first attempts were in blender and then in bpy. I still cant get blender to work the way I want it to so I am rewriting things in openSCAD. It is much nicer.
